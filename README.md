# 🧑🏻‍💻 Engineer Log

A minimalist, high-performance personal blog platform built with **Astro**. This project is designed to document an engineer's journey, focusing on a premium reading experience and fluid interaction design.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Fluid Animation Engine**: Custom scroll-linked focus logic implemented in Vanilla JavaScript. Items transition smoothly as they enter the focus zone using high-end easing for a professional feel.
- **Typography Optimization**: Advanced CSS layout techniques including `word-break: auto-phrase` and `text-wrap: balance/pretty` to ensure natural line breaks, specifically optimized for Japanese and CJK languages.
- **Visual Centering Logic**: A unique layout hack that ensures perfect visual centering for icon-text combinations in the hero section across all screen sizes.
- **Static Search**: Integrated with **Pagefind** for lightning-fast, full-text search without a heavy backend requirement.
- **Interactive Components**: Includes a lightweight "Like" system and a seamless comment section integration.
- **Performance First**: Zero-dependency animations and optimized script execution to maintain high Lighthouse scores and smooth scrolling.
